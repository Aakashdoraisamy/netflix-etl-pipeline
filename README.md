# 🎬 Netflix ETL with Databricks  

## 📌 Overview  
- This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Databricks and PySpark.  
- Work with the Netflix dataset to showcase how data is ingested, cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analytics using the **Bronze-Silver-Gold (Medallion) architecture** in Databricks.  

---

## ⚙️ ETL Process  

### 🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)  
- Ingested the raw CSV file into Databricks using PySpark.  
- Added metadata such as:  
  - `ingest_ts` → ingestion timestamp  
  - `source_file` → source file name  

### 🔸 Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)  
- Cleaned and transformed the data:  
  - Removed duplicates  
  - Standardized date formats  
  - Handled missing values  
- Derived useful fields:  
  - `duration_mins` (movie duration in minutes)  
  - `genres` (split from listed_in)  
  - `content_age` (age since release year)  
- Stored as **Delta Tables** for reliability and ACID compliance.  

### 🟡 Gold Layer (Curated Data)  
- Aggregated and analytics-ready tables.  
- Examples:  
  - Count of shows by country  
  - Distribution by release year  
  - Breakdown by content type (Movies vs TV Shows)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Databricks
- Apache Spark / PySpark  
- Delta Lake  
- SQL (Databricks SQL for queries & analysis)
